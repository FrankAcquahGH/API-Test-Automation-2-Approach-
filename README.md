## Overview
API testing is a critical component of modern software development, ensuring that APIs perform reliably and meet business requirements. Automating API tests within a CI/CD pipeline enhances efficiency, reduces manual effort, and catches issues early. This repository compares two tools for automating Postman collections in CI/CD pipelines:

Postman CLI: A command-line tool provided by Postman for running collections with tight integration to the Postman ecosystem.
Newman: A command-line collection runner for Postman, designed for flexibility and integration with various CI/CD systems.

Both approaches were explored to evaluate their suitability for our team's needs, considering factors like ease of use, scalability, cost, and integration capabilities.

## Postman CLI CI/CD Approach

### What is Postman CLI?
Postman CLI is a command-line interface developed by Postman to execute Postman collections, monitor APIs, and enforce governance rules directly from the terminal. It integrates seamlessly with Postman’s cloud platform, allowing teams to run tests, view results, and manage configurations within the Postman ecosystem.

### Setup Instructions for Postman CLI
1. Install Postman CLI**:
   - Download the Postman CLI from the [Postman website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or install via npm:
     ```bash
     npm install -g @postman/cli
     ```
   - Verify installation:
     ```bash
     postman --version
     ```

2. Authenticate with Postman**:
   - Generate a Postman API key from your Postman account.
   - Configure the CLI with the API key:
     ```bash
     postman login --with-api-key <your-api-key>
     ```

3. Export Collections**:
   - Export your Postman collection and environment as JSON files from the Postman app.
   - Store these files in your repository (e.g., `tests/my-collection.json`, `tests/my-environment.json`).

4. Run Collections Locally**:
   - Test the collection locally:
     ```bash
     postman collection run <collection-id> --environment <environment-id>
     ```

### CI/CD Integration for Postman CLI
The Postman CLI can be integrated with CI/CD systems like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins. Below is an example for GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Postman CLI CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Postman CLI
        run: |
          npm install -g @postman/cli
          postman --version

      - name: Login to Postman
        run: postman login --with-api-key ${{ secrets.POSTMAN_API_KEY }}
